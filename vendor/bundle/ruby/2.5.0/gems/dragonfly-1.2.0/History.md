1.2.0 (2018-11-13)
===================
Fixes
-----
- Replaced `quote` with `escape` for escaping shell commands - works with paths with apostrophes
Changes
-----
- Replaced Open3.popen3 with now recommended Open3.capture3 (tomasc)

1.1.5 (2018-03-23)
===================
Fixes
-----
- Moved `destroy_dragonfly_attachments` into an `after_destroy` - issue #477 (eldotz)

1.1.4 (2017-12-31)
===================
Fixes
-----
- Fixed data uris not working for long strings (reported dlibanori)
- Removed syntax warnings (swamp09)
- Correct ActiveRecord hook with `ActiveSupport.on_load` (efatsi)

1.1.3 (2017-06-02)
===================
Fixes
-----
- Make sure imagemagick convert processor updates mime_type correctly when format is changed

1.1.2 (2017-05-06)
===================
Fixes
-----
- Allow relative redirect urls in `fetch_url` (zorec)
- Fixed Forwardable deprecation warnings (neodude)
- Fixed incorrect detection of empty directories in ruby 2.4 (yuszuv)

===================
Features
--------
- Added delegate option for imagemagick (Will Fisher)

Fixes
-----
- Use `Base64.urlsafe_encode64` (Jan Raasch)
  Note that this changes b64 encodings from '/' to `'_'` and '+' to '-' in URLs, which will change a very
  small number of generated URLs (but shouldn't be enough to cause big recaching problems)
  URLs are encoded now according to the URL safe base64 specification in RFC 4648.
  Old URLs are still recognized so won't break.


1.1.0 (2016-10-24)
===================
Fixes

1.0.8 (2015-04-23)
===================
Fixes
--------
- Job#close re-added, so that tempfiles are immediately removed after each request
- Specs passing for 1.8.7, 1.9.2 (i18n gem version specified)

1.0.7 (2014-08-26)
===================
Changes
--------
- Job#sha uses better algorithm
- renamed `protect_from_dos_attacks` -> `verify_urls` and turn on by default

1.0.6 (2014-08-22)
===================
Features
--------
- env can be accessed by routed endpoint blocks

Fixes
-----
- analyser cache doesn't get stored in meta for a given piece of meta - can mess with stringifying analyser return values
- removed default secret, forcing user to specify one explicitly
- deal with "[" character problems in urls https://github.com/markevans/dragonfly/pull/337

1.0.5 (2014-05-15)
===================
Fixes
-----
- fetch_url wasn't correctly getting https endpoints on Ruby approx < 2

1.0.4 (2014-04-11)
===================
Fixes
-----
- fetch_url is more forgiving - assume escaped, if not escape

1.0.3 (2014-01-28)
===================
Fixes
-----
- changing meta on a job (e.g. `fetch('blah').encode('jpg')`) was interfering with meta on its parent job (e.g. `fetch('blah')`)

1.0.2 (2013-12-20)
===================
Fixes
-----
- more secure generation of secret in rails generator
- ensure popen3 doesn't hang

1.0.1 (2013-11-28)
===================
Changes
-------
- FileDataStore doesn't use hours_minutes_seconds in its path - it uses a random string instead (12_15_59_saf4fs_file.png -> sdf4c2G_file.png)

Features
--------
- model attribute `xxx_changed?` method (useful e.g. in validations)

Fixes
-----
- proper support for Ruby 1.8.7 and JRuby (version 1.7.8)
- routed endpoints can deal with returned `Attachment` objects (rather than returned `Job` objects) and return 404 if the endpoint proc returns nil
- default Content-Disposition header doesn't url-encode filename unless the request is from IE
- `fetch_url` deals with urls that redirect to https (previously was blowing up)

1.0.0 (2013-11-24)
===================
Changes
-------
- configuration
  - `Dragonfly[:images]` -> `Dragonfly.app` and `Dragonfly.app(:named_app)`
  - configuration block DSL overhaul
  - Rails is set up using a generator, not by requiring the file "dragonfly/rails/images"
  - Rack::Cache is not inserted by Dragonfly - this is up to the user
- data store spec
  - `store`/`retrieve` -> `read`/`write`
  - `write` takes a `Content`, not a `TempObject` (though the interface is much the same)
  - return nil on `read` to signify not found instead of raising
- S3, Couch and Mongo data stores extracted into separate gems
- models
  - easier and simpler to include in custom models using `Dragonfly::Model`
  - `image_accessor`, `asset_accessor`, `xxx_accessor`, etc. -> single `dragonfly_accessor`
  - user needs to extend `Dragonfly::Model::Validations` manually to use dragonfly validations
- Custom processors, datastores, generators and analysers are made easier by `Content` object which has convenience methods
- Removed "encoders" - these are covered by processors now
- Removed "job" shortcuts - they are not needed as processors can invoke other processors
- No "smart" determination of mime-type - just use file extension (anything more than that can be done by the user)
- metadata is required to be serializable to/from JSON
- removed `allow_fetch_file` and `allow_fetch_url` in favour of more fine-control with `fetch_file_whitelist` and `fetch_url_whitelist`
- switch off dealing with legacy urls by default
- proper requires throughout the code instead of autoloading
- simple 500 response for unknown errors

Features
--------
- model attachment default (by specifying a path to a e.g. a default image)
- `convert` and `thumb` processors take a `'frame'` option
- `thumb` takes a `'format'` option
- `fetch_file` and `model.attachment_url=` accept a data uri string
- `Attachment#xxx_stored`, e.g. `my_model.my_attachment_stored?` (`my_attachment` here being the attachment name)
- `define` for creating custom methods on `Job`/`Attachment` objects
- `url_path_prefix` for when mounted in Rack with a "SCRIPT_NAME"
- when customizing response headers, ability to remove headers by setting to `nil`
- better logging
  - for each response
  - for shell commands

Fixes
-----
- inserting CookieMonster doesn't depend on existence of `ActionDispatch::Cookies`
- `image?` returns false for pdfs
- `fetch_url` raises more useful `ErrorResponse` on error
- shell commands don't print warnings to stderr
- ability to assign attachment/job from other app

0.9.15 (2013-05-04)
===================
Features
--------
- Allow turning off support of legacy urls

Fixes
-----
- More conservative URL escaping - back to Rack::Utils.escape_path
- Don't check for malicious strings when deserializing from datastores (they're to be trusted)

0.9.14 (2013-02-13)
===================
Features
--------
- Attachment#b64_data

Fixes
-----
- Fix '+' character being converted to ' ' (revert to URI.escape instead of Rack::Utils.escape)
- Support old-style deprecated urls (with a check for malicious ones)
- Handle case where uid is an empty string

0.9.13 (2013-01-30)

===================
Features
-------
- Allow using a mongo replica set with mongo datastore

Fixes
-----
- `define_macro_on_include` was giving a stack error with multiple accessors on same app

0.9.11 (2012-03-12)
===================
Features
-------
- Allow the S3 base URL to be customised with `url_host` (or per-request)
- Added App#name (name as per `Dragonfly[:app_name]`)

Changes
-------
- Better inspect for App, Processor, Analyser, Encoder, Generator, Job, TempObject, RoutedEndpoint, JobEndpoint

Fixes
-----
- Rescue from Excon::Errors::Conflict which apparently gets raised sometimes (don't know why - see https://github.com/markevans/dragonfly/issues/167)
- Alias portrait and landscape without question marks, so magic_attributes can be used with them
- Fixed stack error when using `define_macro_on_include` twice
- Use fog's `sync_clock` to overcome potential S3 time skew problems
- Using :name in urls was causing problems when filenames had dashes in them

0.9.10 (2012-01-11)
===================
Fixes
-----
- FileDataStore was causing errors when the storage path was flat (not in a directory structure)

0.9.9 (2011-12-30)
==================
Features
--------
- Created tempfiles use the original file extension if known
- Added `:case_sensitive` option to `validates_property` for dealing with upper-case extensions and mime-types.
- Github Markup syntax on readme for code highlighting
- S3DataStore can use https for remote urls (either configurable or per-url)
- `to_file` can take `:mode` option for setting custom permissions
- `to_file` creates intermediate subdirs by default, can be turned off with `:mkdirs => false` option
- Added some more S3 regions

Changes
-------
- Datastores now use `temp_object.meta`, not the second arg passed in to `store`
- `meta`, `name`, etc. now lazily load the job on an attachment - previously you'd have to call `apply` to get the meta from the datastore
- When assigning an image via the activemodel extensions, mark that uid attribute will change
- `validates_property` uses Rails 3 validators
- Deprecated saved 'heroku' config, in favour of configuring S3 explicitly

Fixes
-----
- Model attachment urls are consistent now - the name is appended to the url (with format "/:job/:name") ONLY if it has the "name" magic attribute
- `identify` wasn't working properly for files with capital letter extensions
- S3 datastore sets content mime_type by default
- File extensions with numbers like JP2 weren't being processed/analysed properly
- Protect against object_ids being recycled and messing with analyser cache
- All url segments are correctly url-escaped now
- Fixed TempObject File.open mode
- S3DataStore was breaking on bucket_exists? when using AWS IAM
- Put CookieMonster before ActionDispatch::Cookies in rack middleware stack - that way Rack::Cache won't come between them and mess things up

0.9.8 (2011-09-08)
==================
Fixes
-----
- Regenerated gemspec again with ruby 1.8.7 - didn't seem to be fixed

0.9.7 (2011-09-08)
==================
Fixes
-----

- Fixed size validations for Rails 3.0.7

0.9.4 (2011-06-10)
==================
Fixes
-----
- Made use of Rack calling `close` on the response body to clean up tempfiles.
  The response body is now the job, which delegates `each` to the temp_object.

0.9.3 (2011-06-03)
==================
Fixes
-----
- TempObject#to_file sets file permissions 644 - copying wasn't previously guaranteeing this
- Added TempObject#close and closed?, which Rack uses to clean up tempfiles
- replaced '/' characters with '~' in base64 encoded urls (they were confusing url recognition)

0.9.2 (2011-05-19)

Changes
-------
- Removed `url_path_prefix` and `url_suffix` in favour of `url_format`
  - Middleware doesn't need mount point argument now
- Removed support for rails 2.3
- Removed RMagick support (and extracted into a plugin)
- ImageMagick processors etc. moved into the ImageMagick namespace
- moved from aws/s3 -> fog for S3 support
- Renamed SimpleEndpoint -> Server
- moved name and meta into Job, simplified, and now they don't cause the job to be applied
- FileDataStore stores metadata in xxx.meta now, not xxx.extra
- removed Job methods `uid_basename`, `uid_extname`, `encoded_format` and `encoded_extname` as they are now unnecessary

Fixes
-----
- Performance tweaks regarding temp_objects model accessors and job objects

0.8.5 (2011-05-11)
==================
